#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, maintenance, testing and evaluation of software. It 
focuses on designing, building and optimizing software systems tobe reliable, scalable and efficiant. Software Engineering powers modern technology, from mobile apps to AI, cloud computing and blockchain. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software Engineering was first introduced NATO 1968 software engineering conference to address the "Software Crisis" where software projects were often 
late, over budget, or failed completely.
1. The Development of the Waterfall Model:
 The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest methodologies in software engineering, introduced in the 1970s. It is a linear sequential model that outlines a series 
 of phases in the software development process that are requirements analysis, system design, implementation, integration and testing, deployment, and 
 maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next one can begin, with little room for revisiting earlier stages.
 Waterfall Model provided a structured approach to software development, making it easier to manage large projects and communicate progress to stakeholders.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in 1980:
 The introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software design by organizing code into reusable objects instead of complex procedures. 
 Languages like C++ (1983) and Java (1995) popularized OOP, making software more modular, scalable, and maintainable. This shift significantly improved the 
 development of large-scale systems, including operating systems, web applications, and enterprise software.
3. Agile Methodologies:
 The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, revolutionized software development by promoting iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. 
 Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), prioritize customer collaboration, iterative feedback, and working software over extensive 
 documentation and rigid planning. Agile movement shifted the focus from strict processes to adaptive frameworks that embrace change. It have since become widely 
 adopted across the industry, facilitating faster delivery of software, higher quality, and better alignment with customer needs. The principles of Agile have 
 also influenced organizational culture, encouraging transparency, teamwork, and continuous improvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It ensures efficient and high-quality 
software gevelopment.
1. Planning :
   It where the projects feasibility and scope are determined. Stakeholders identify objectives, gather requirement and establish a project timeline and budget. 
   Key activities: Defining project goals and scope
                   Conducting feasibility studies
                   Creating a project plan and schedule
2. Requirement Analysis:
   It detailed requirements are gathered from stakeholders and uses. This includes functional and non-functional requirements, which outline what the software 
   should do and how it should perform.
   Key activities: Collecting requirements through interviews, serveys or workshops
                   Documenting user requirements and system specification
                   Creating use cases and user stories
3. Design:
   Its involves translating requirements into a blueprint for building the software. This includes architectural design, interface design, and data modeling.
   The goal is to create a detailed design document that outlines the system's structure.
   Key activities:
                   Designing software architecture and components
                   Creating models
                   Specifying the user interface and experience
4. Development:
   Developers write the software according to the specifications provided in the design phase. Integrated development environments (IDEs) and version control 
   systems are commonly used.
   Key activities:
                   Writing code for modules and components
                   Conducting unit tests to ensure individual pieces function correctly
                   Collaborating between developers through version control
5. Testing:
   Is where the software is rigorously tested to identify and fix defects or discrepancies. Various testing methodologies (e.g., unit testing, integration 
   testing, system testing, and acceptance testing) are utilized to validate the functionality and performance.
   Key activities:
                   Performing different types of testing (functional, performance, security)
                   Reporting and fixing bugs or issues
                   Conducting user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the software meets business needs
6. Deployment:
   Once the software is tested and approved, it is deployed to a production environment. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and running the 
   software in a live setting. It can also include a gradual rollout or pilot testing.
   Key activities:
                   Installing the software on user systems or servers
                   Configuring the environment and performing data migrations
                   Providing training and documentation to users
7. Maintenance:
   After deployment, the software will require ongoing maintenance and support. This phase involves fixing any issues that arise, making updates, and 
   implementing enhancements based on user feedback and changing requirements.
   Key activities:
                   Monitoring software performance
                   Addressing user-reported issues or bugs
                   Implementing updates and new features

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Structure and Process:
   Waterfall:
   Waterfall is a linear and sequential model where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. It typically includes stages such as requirements 
   analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
   Changes to requirements are difficult and often costly to implement once a phase is complete.
   Agile:
   Agile encourages ongoing collaboration with stakeholders and allows for continuous improvement and adaptability throughout the development process.
2. Customer Involvement
   Waterfall:
   Customer involvement is typically concentrated at the beginning (requirements gathering) and the end (user acceptance testing) of the project. This can lead 
   to situations where the final product does not meet user expectations if requirements change during development.
   Agile:
   Its promotes continuous customer involvement throughout the development process. Stakeholders provide feedback at the end of each iteration, allowing teams 
   to make adjustments based on real user input and insights.
3. Documentation
   Waterfall:
   It places a heavy emphasis on documentation. Detailed design documents, requirement specifications, and other documentation are created before development
   begins.
   Agile:
   Agile practices focus on "just enough" documentation that supports the development process. Documentation is often created collaboratively, and the emphasis 
   is on working software over comprehensive documentation.
4. Risk Management
   Waterfall:
   Risks are often managed through thorough planning and design in the early phases. However, because changes late in the project can be expensive, some 
   unforeseen risks may not be addressed until later stages.
   Agile:
   Agile embraces risk management as an ongoing activity, with risks identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the lifecycle. The iterative nature of Agile 
   allows teams to respond quickly to changing circumstances.
Example Scenarios:
 Waterfall
  Government Projects – Often require strict documentation and fixed requirements.
  Construction Software – Where all requirements must be planned before development.
  Medical Software – Requires extensive testing and regulatory approval before release.
 Agile
  Startup Mobile Apps – Frequent changes and iterations based on user feedback.
  E-Commerce Websites – Continuous updates for new features and improvements.
  Game Development – Regular testing and user feedback drive improvements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce the best possible outputnfrom a generative AI 
model. A prompt is natural languagetext describing th task that an AI should perform.
Importance in interacting with AI models:
It helps improve AI-generated content (text, code, images).
Well-structured prompts help AI generate clearer, more relevant, and useful responses.
Optimizes AI Efficiency: Reduces the need for multiple follow-up clarifications by making the initial prompt precise.
Enables Task-Specific AI Use: Prompt engineering is essential in fields like content creation, coding, data analysis, and automation.
Improves AI Creativity and Innovation: AI can generate stories, designs, and solutions based on detailed prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt: Is "Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt: Is "Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, with examples of real-world applications."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
More Specific: Instead of a broad topic like "technology," it narrows the focus to artificial intelligence in healthcare.
Clear Objective: It explicitly asks for real-world applications, guiding the AI to provide practical examples instead of a generic response.
Concise & Direct: The improved prompt eliminates ambiguity, making it easier for the AI to generate relevant and informative content.
